# med-aws-node-react

Tasks:

1. Setup a React app on AWS using this tutorial and any other AWS docs or other support you need (it's not a test of WHAT you know, it's an exercise to demonstrate HOW you work). 
tutorial: https://serverless-stack.com/

2. Please track your time.  This is not artificial, when you work here, we do keep detailed tracking info to use for project management and estimates and predictive analysis.  

3. Stop if you are hitting problems and stuck or if things are taking much longer than expected. The goal is not to have you slave away for free forever, nor do we care if you "finish".  We just want to get a data point on how you work, especially when doing new things. We don't expect you are fluent in, or practiced with, any of these tools but we want to see how you approach the problem. If you can accomplish that in a couple hours, fantastic. If you want to spend more time, awesome. But at some point stop.  That is a skill as well.  And knowing when to stop is more often more important than knowing all the answers.  

4. Write down and document your questions, problems, resources used, code copied, etc.  Send me a summary of your progress and any links if you get a working app deployed.
